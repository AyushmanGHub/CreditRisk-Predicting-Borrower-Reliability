---

## üîç Introduction  

Credit card default is a critical issue in the financial sector, where banks and financial institutions need to assess the risk associated with lending. This project aims to develop a **machine learning model** that predicts whether a customer will default on their credit card payment.  

Using the **AmExpert CodeLab 2021 dataset**, we analyze various demographic, financial, and credit-related features to identify patterns in customer behavior. The goal is to **enhance risk assessment strategies**, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions and reduce financial losses.  

In this project, we explore different machine learning techniques, including **ensemble models, deep learning, and feature engineering**, to improve predictive accuracy.

## üå≤ Extra Tree Classifier
The **Extra Trees Classifier (Extremely Randomized Trees)** is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their results to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Unlike Random Forest, it selects split points **completely at random**, making it more computationally efficient while maintaining strong predictive performance.

## üå± Decision Tree Classifier
The **Decision Tree Classifier** is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It builds a tree-like model by recursively splitting the dataset based on feature values. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node corresponds to a class label. The model selects the feature that best separates the data at each step using criteria such as **Gini Impurity** or **Information Gain**.
